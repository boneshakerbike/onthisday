## Story Generation Instructions

Transform the story above into a polished Substack post following these guidelines:

**Narrative Structure:**
- Preserve the author's structure and flow — do not reorganize or impose a different paragraph count.
- Enhance the storytelling with vivid detail, natural pacing, and emotional resonance.
- Write as one continuous narrative with no section headers or breaks.

**Style Calibration:**
- Tone: Balance humor and seriousness (slightly more serious than funny, but with wit present)
- Voice: Conversational, diary-like, simple, straightforward (casual but not sloppy)
- Attitude: Courteous with occasional irreverence or sarcasm (mostly respectful)
- Energy: Show clear enthusiasm for outdoor life and meaningful moments, but keep it direct and understated (more matter-of-fact than gushing)

**Audience:**
Write for friends, family, and outdoor enthusiasts. The story should feel like sharing an experience over a beer or during a trail break.

**Length and Format:**
- Total word count: 200-350 words
- Keep technical explanations to 1-2 sentences maximum
- Use continuous narrative flow
- Replace em dashes with ellipses or commas
- No emojis
- Vary sentence length and rhythm intentionally
- Allow occasional quirks, fragmented thoughts, or imperfect phrasing to sound natural and human

**Humor and Mood:**
- Use witty humor throughout
- Lean into absurd or unexpected details with playful commentary
- Do not undercut genuinely serious or emotional moments with jokes
- You may add light personal color or exaggeration for comedic effect

**Optional Enhancements:**
- Include short bursts of researched detail about locations, events, or outdoor trivia if relevant
- If images are provided, reference them naturally in the story

**Ending:**
Always conclude with a reflective, meaningful takeaway that conveys appreciation or gratitude in a subtle, grounded way. The closing thought should feel original and lived-in, not like a slogan or aphorism. Avoid formulaic wisdom, inspirational clichEs, or stock structures. Aim for a quiet insight that deepens the moment rather than summarizing it. Avoid cliche words like "maybe".

## Titles and Subtitles

This is the part that matters most, and the part most often done badly. Read these rules carefully.

**The title** (2 to 7 words):
- It must come out of THIS story's specific details. If the title could sit on top of somebody else's post about a different day, it is wrong.
- Funny is good. Quirky is good. Dry is good. Generic wistfulness is not.
- Use the actual nouns from the story, the odd ones especially: the equipment, the place names, the animals, the errands, the rule the author made up.
- No colons. No "A Story of". No rhyming. No alliteration for its own sake.

**Banned title templates.** These are worn out. Do not produce a title that fits any of these shapes, in any wording:
${banned_templates_block}

Also avoid anything that merely rhymes with those shapes, e.g. "Something Something, Again and Again", "When the Wind Had Other Plans", "The Quiet Art of Waiting". If a title feels like it came pre-made off a shelf, throw it out and write another.

**Titles already used.** Every title below has been used before. Do not repeat any of them and do not produce a near-reword of one:
${used_titles_block}

**Angles to try for this post.** Push at least a couple of your options through these specific approaches:
${angles.map(a => `- ${a}`).join('\n')}

**The subtitle** (10 to 25 words, one sentence, no period required):
- This is NOT a second punchline. It is the deck: it tells the reader what the post actually contains, in a wry, slightly deadpan voice.
- Concrete and specific. Listing the real things that happened is good, especially when the list is absurd on its own.
- Examples of the right shape and length:
  - "Blood draws, physical therapy, wasps, brake repairs, and the surprisingly exhausting act of doing the right thing."
  - "A masterclass in how an entire day can disappear without turning a single pedal."
  - "Featuring a vampire, a physical therapist, angry wasps, hydraulic brakes, and exactly zero mountain biking."
- Do not use those examples. They show the register and length only.

**Required Output Format:**

Present your story using the following exact format:

Title: [The strongest title, per the rules above]
Sub Title: [The matching subtitle, per the rules above]

[Write the complete narrative here following all guidelines above. Do not use any tags.]

captions

[If images were provided, create a bulleted list of short witty captions for each image. Format as "Image 1: [Caption]", "Image 2: [Caption]"]

[If no images were provided, write "No images provided."]

alternate titles

[Six more title and subtitle pairs, each genuinely different from the headline pair and from each other, not six rewordings of one idea. Range from dry to absurd. Follow every title and subtitle rule above. Format each on one line, exactly like this:]
1. Title: [title] | Sub Title: [subtitle]
2. Title: [title] | Sub Title: [subtitle]
3. Title: [title] | Sub Title: [subtitle]
4. Title: [title] | Sub Title: [subtitle]
5. Title: [title] | Sub Title: [subtitle]
6. Title: [title] | Sub Title: [subtitle]`;

Extract the durable knowledge and drop everything else: greetings, chat turn-taking, "as I mentioned", speaker labels, navigation chrome, cookie banners, and other scaffolding around the actual content.

You cannot look anything up, so do not pretend to verify claims against the outside world. Instead:
- Record only what the material actually supports. Never invent facts, names, dates, or numbers to fill a gap.
- Where the material contradicts itself, say so rather than silently picking a side.
- Collect anything uncertain, unsourced, or contradictory under a final "## Unverified" section. Omit that section entirely when there is nothing to put in it.

Structure:
- Open with a single line "# Subject" naming what the document is about. Use a short noun phrase, not a sentence. This names the file, so make it specific.
- Follow with one or two sentences of summary, then "##" sections grouping related facts.
- Prefer bullets for lists of facts and prose for anything that needs explanation.
- Keep the author's terminology. Do not use em dashes; use commas, ellipses, or semicolons instead.

Fix all spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. You may go further than a simple cleanup: split or merge sentences, surface implicit logic, and reorder ideas so the point lands clearly.
